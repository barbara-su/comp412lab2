This directory contains the two versions of the ILOC block
from slide 25 of the second Lab 2 Video.

     slides-original.i is the code before renaming
     slides-renamed.i is the code after renaming

Both blocks expect input of -i 128 1 2 3 and both blocks should
produce the number 7 on stdout.

If you run the blocks with the simulator's -x option, you should
the following results.

    [comp412@jade example]$ ../sim -x -i 128 1 2 3 slides-original.i 
    COMP 412, Lab 2 Code Check:
    7

    Executed 10 instructions and 10 operations in 14 cycles.
    Code Check: failed, with 2 reassignments.
    [comp412@jade example]$ 

If you look at the original block, it defines each of r1 and r3 twice.
By contrast, the renamed block defines each register name exactly once.

    [comp412@jade example]$ ../sim -x -i 128 1 2 3 slides-renamed.i 
    COMP 412, Lab 2 Code Check:
    7

    Executed 10 instructions and 10 operations in 14 cycles.
    Code Check: passed.
