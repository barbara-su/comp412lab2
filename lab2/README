COMP 412 Lab 2

This directory contains:

  autograder:   contains the distribution of the "stripped down" autograder
  		and autotimer.

  CodeChecks: 	The tools needed to demonstrate that your implementation
  		passes code check 1 and code check 2.

		See the README file in the CodeChecks directory.

  lab2_ref:     the reference implementation of the ILOC local register
  		allocator.  Note that lab2_ref DOES NOT implement the -x 
		command-line flag.

		The comments in the output file may provide some insight
		into what lab2_ref is doing to the input program.

  README:	This file

  report:  	a subset of the test blocks that we will use to grade your
  		implementation. These are included in the "stripped down"
		autograder.

		The production autograder will also use some test blocks that
		are hidden from you.


 scripts:	This directory contains both a testing script and a timing
 		script. The testing script invokes your allocator at a
		variety of values of k on every ILOC file in a directory.

		For each file and each value of k, the testing script
		checks the allocated code by running it through the
		simulator and verifying that the allocated code produces
		the answers specified in the //OUTPUT: specification.

		The timing script uses the SLOCs scalability blocks to
		provide a quick timing test. The autotimer is both slower
		and more precise.
  sim:		an executable version of the lab 2 ILOC simulator compiled
  		for execution on CLEAR (see next entry).

  simulator:	This directory contains the code for the lab 2 ILOC 
  		simulator. You will need to use the simulator to test your
		allocator. If you want a copy to use locally, lab2sim.tar
		should contain everything necessary to build one. The file
		SimDoc.pdf provides details on operation of the simulator.

		Note that the lab 2 simulator is different than the lab 3
		simulator.

  slides.i:	The ILOC block used as an example in the lab video on allocation.
